Sharp Music Library Updater [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bkh9ghotmfc1hiis?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/danplisetsky/sharpmusiclibraryupdater)
========================
## Elevator Pitch
Have a sizable music llibrary? Store it in a folder, band by band? Want to know when one of the bands releases a new album without having to check for it manually? Then this is an app for you!
## What does it actually do?
| You | It |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1. Point to your music folder | Reads the folders in your music folder and checks them as bands' names against the iTunes Store.|
| 2. Press the "Check for new albums" button | Checks the iTunes Store to see which of your bands have released new albums that are missing from your collection |
| 3. Click on a band's name | Check out the new albums |

That's it!
## Any issues?
Plenty, as this is an early release and only the most basic functionality is implemented. More to come!
